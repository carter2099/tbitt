The Boys in the Trenchesâ„¢

Made with Cursor and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Worked very well for broad strokes in the beginning.
Had to become more surgical as time went on. I was impressed with the ability to quickly add
functionality using Cursor and Claude but the code quality left something to be desired.
Cursor/Claude preferred to put as much of the application into one file as it could. In addition,
if there were existing functions elsewhere, it wouldn't reuse them, instead rewriting them at
the location of the current edit. The biggest positive was how fun it was. Typing in a chatbox
to build an app was an exciting, novel experience.

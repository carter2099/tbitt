The Boys in the Trenchesâ„¢

This app shows the user top memecoins on Solana launched in the past 5, 10, 15, 30 min based on an algorithm
that takes into account price action, market cap, and other metrics.

Made with Cursor and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Worked very well for broad strokes in the beginning.
Had to become more surgical as time went on. I was impressed with the ability to quickly add
functionality using Cursor and Claude but the code quality left something to be desired.
Cursor/Claude preferred to put as much of the application into one file as it could. In addition,
if there were existing functions elsewhere, it wouldn't reuse them, instead rewriting them at
the location of the current edit. The biggest positive was how fun it was. Typing in a chatbox
to build an app was an exciting, novel experience.

## July 8, 2025 Update: Rip

As of August 1, 2025, [Jupiter is deprecating its /new Tokens API with no replacement.](https://dev.jup.ag/docs/token-api/v1)

I will be on the hunt for another sufficient API, but as the meme madness has died down this app isn't used as much anymore. It won't be a priority.
